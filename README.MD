# _Currency Converter_

#### _A program to convert currencies, 2/14/2018_

#### By _**James Donlan**_

## Description

_Convert between five exciting currencies, including three kinds of dollar! And then find out how many nights you can afford to stay in lodging that costs the local equivalent of $89, should such a deal be available._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone repo from github_
* _use a terminal to navigate to the folder location_
* _run npm install_
* _type npm run prod and open the newly created index.html found in currency/build/ in a browser_
* _Or use npm run dev to start the development server, which will open in a browser automatically and functions about the same_
* _type npm run test if you'd like to see the tests pass_

## Proposed Future Functionality

* _More currencies, possibly ones that don't have a dollars-and-cents structure, which sounds like it would complicate things._
* _Fictional currencies? Probably run into a similar issue with denominations eventually, but it could be fun if that's solvable._
* _Return additional messages if you're converting a currency to itself, can't afford a single night's stay, or can afford a notably long vacation._
* _Add extra styling._

## Technologies Used

* _HTML_
* _JavaScript_
* _jQuery_
* _CSS_
* _bootstrap_
* _webpack_
* _mocha_
* _chai_
* _node_
